##Abstract
In this project, we analyzed the 111th-114th roll calls in the US Senate (2012-2015), by applying unsupervised learning methods to assess the association between pairs of senators based on the votes they cast. For pairs, we used similarity-based methods, including hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling. We also applied information entropy to find the most influential senators during these periods. By doing so, we observed the gap between Democratic Party and Republican Party increases with time. The senatorsâ€™ goal and behavior is more and more consistent to their representative party.
